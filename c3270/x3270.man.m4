host (XX_FB(Enter),
XX_FB(Clear), XX_FB(PA) and XX_FB(PF)).
When set, these actions no longer block until the host unlocks the keyboard.
It is up to the script to poll the prompt for the unlocked state, or to use
the XX_FB(Wait(Unlock)) action to wait for the unlock.
ifelse(XX_INTERACTIVE,yes,`XX_TP(XX_FB(altCursor))
If set, the cursor will be an underline. If clear, it will be a solid block.
')dnl
XX_TP(XX_FB(blankFill))
If set, XX_FB(XX_PRODUCT) modifies interactive 3270 behavior in two ways.
First, when a character is typed into a field, all nulls in the field to the
left of that character are changed to blanks.
This eliminates a common 3270 data-entry surprise.
Second, in insert mode, trailing blanks in a field are treated like nulls,
eliminating the annoying XX_DQUOTED(lock-up) that often occurs when inserting
into an field with (apparent) space at the end.
ifelse(XX_MODE,console,`XX_TP(XX_FB(crosshair))
When set, XX_PRODUCT will display a crosshair to help locate the cursor on the
screen.
')dnl
XX_TP(XX_FB(lineWrap))
If set, the XX_SM(NVT) terminal emulator automatically assumes
a XX_SM(NEWLINE) character when it reaches the end of a line.
ifelse(XX_PRODUCT,wc3270,`XX_TP(XX_FB(marginedPaste))
If set, pasting multi-line input via the XX_FB(Paste) action will maintain a
left margin (it will not move the cursor further left than where the paste
begins).
')dnl
ifelse(XX_INTERACTIVE,yes,`XX_TP(XX_FB(monoCase))
If set, XX_FB(XX_PRODUCT) operates in uppercase-only mode.
')dnl
ifelse(XX_PRODUCT,wc3270,`XX_TP(XX_FB(overlayPaste))
If set, pasting over a protected field will simply increment the cursor
position instead of locking the keyboard.
This allows forms to be copied and pasted with the protected fields
included.
Setting this toggle also implicitly sets the XX_FB(marginedPaste) toggle.
')dnl
XX_TP(XX_FB(screenTrace))
Turns on screen tracing at start-up.
Each time the screen changes, its contents are appended to the file

the status line.

XX_TP(XX_FB(trace))
Turns on data stream and event tracing at start-up.

The directory for the trace file can be changed with
the "XX_PRODUCT.traceDir" resource.
Script commands are also traced.
ifelse(XX_MODE,console,`XX_TP(XX_FB(underscore))
If set, XX_PRODUCT will display underlined fields by substituting
underscore XX_DQUOTED(_) characters for blanks or nulls in the field.
Otherwise, these fields will be displayed
ifelse(XX_PRODUCT,c3270,`using the XX_POSESSIVE(terminal) native
underlining mode, if one is defined.

Note that setting XX_FB(underscore) also disables the highlighted background
for blinking fields.
XX_FB(underscore) is set by default.
')dnl
')dnl
ifelse(XX_MODE,console,`XX_TP(XX_FB(visibleControl))
If set, control characters (NULLs, SI/SO and field attributes), which are
usually displayed as blanks, are visible on the display.
NULs become periods, SO becomes XX_DQUOTED(XX_LT()),
SI becomes XX_DQUOTED(>).
Field attributes are mapped onto the characters 0 through 9 and A through V
and are displayed in

Three characters indicate the keyboard modifier status.
"M" indicates the Meta key, "A" the Alt key, and an up-arrow or "^"

XX_TP(XX_FB(compose))
The letter "C" indicates that a composite character is in progress.
If another symbol follows the "C", it is the first character of the
composite.

XX_TP(XX_FB(typeahead))
The letter "T" indicates that one or more keystrokes are in the typeahead
buffer.
XX_TP(XX_FB(temporary keymap))
The letter "K" indicates that a temporary keymap is in effect.
XX_TP(XX_FB(reverse))

XX_TP(XX_FB(cursor position))
The cursor row and column are optionally displayed, zero padded and separated

option is given (or the "XX_PRODUCT.activeIcon" resource is set to

XX_FB(XX_PRODUCT) will attempt to make its icon a miniature version of the

defaults to XX_FB(50x50).

The icon cannot accept keyboard input.
XX_TP(XX_FB(olwm))
The full screen image of all 3270 models can be displayed on the icon.
However, the icon cannot be resized, so if the model is later changed with an
XX_FB(XX_PRODUCT) menu option, the icon image will be corrupted.
The icon cannot accept keyboard input.

The full screen image of all 3270 models can be displayed on the icon, and the
icon can be resized.
The icon can accept keyboard input.
XX_IP
However, XX_FB(twm) does not put labels on application-supplied icon windows.
You can have XX_FB(XX_PRODUCT)
add its own label to the icon by setting the "XX_PRODUCT.labelIcon" resource to
XX_FB(true).
The default font for icon labels is
XX_FB(8x13);

The default form wth no arguments sends a copy of the screen to the default
printer.
A single argument is

`the command to use to print, e.g., XX_FB(lpr)').
ifelse(XX_PLATFORM,windows,`The font defaults to XX_FB(Courier New) and the

resources, respectively.
Unless the XX_FB(wordpad) keyword is used to force the output to be run through
the Windows WordPad utility, additional resources can control the
output. XX_FB(printTextHorizontalMargin) defines the left- and right-hand
margins. XX_FB(printTextVerticalMargin) defines the top and bottom margins.
Both default to 0.5 inches; the values are in inches by default but can be
suffixed with XX_FB(mm) or XX_FB(cm). XX_FB(printTextOrientation) defines the

There is also an alternate form of the XX_FB(String) XX_action, XX_FB(HexString),
which is used to enter non-printing data.
The argument to XX_FB(HexString) is a string of hexadecimal digits, two per

In 3270 mode, the hexadecimal data represent XX_SM(EBCDIC) characters, which
are entered into the current field.

`XX_TP(XX_FB(The macros Resource))
An alternate method of defining macros is the "XX_PRODUCT.macros" resource.
This resource is similar to a keymap, but instead of defining keyboard
mappings, it associates a list of X actions with a name.
These names are displayed on a Macros menu that appears when XX_FB(XX_PRODUCT)
is connected to a host.
Selecting one of the names on the menu executes the X actions associated with
it.
Typically the actions are XX_FB(String) calls, but any action may be specified.

Macros menu:
XX_RS(XX_PRODUCT.macros: XX_BS()

XX_IP
You can also define a different set of macros for each host.

XX_DQUOTED(XX_PRODUCT.XX_FI(macros).XX_FI(somehost)),
it defines the macros menu for when XX_FB(XX_PRODUCT)

Pressing and releasing the "Compose" key, followed by two other keys, causes
entry of the symbol combining those two keys.
For example, "Compose" followed by the "C" key and the "," (comma) key, enters
the "C-cedilla" symbol.
A `C' on the status line indicates a pending composite character.
XX_PP
The mappings between these pairs of ordinary keys and the symbols they
represent is controlled by the "XX_PRODUCT.composeMap" resource; it gives the

XX_FB(lpr).
You may also use a keymap definition to pass a print command the
XX_FB(PrintText) action itself.

For example, the following keymap will save the screen text in a file:
XX_IP
XX_RS(XX_KEY(Meta,f): PrintText("cat >screen.image"))
XX_PP
Note: XX_FB(HardPrint) is an alias for XX_FB(PrintText).
XX_PP
The XX_FB(PrintWindow) action (usually assigned to the key XX_LT()Meta>b) sends the current
